/*
Time Complexity:

In each step of the binary search, the algorithm reduces the search range by half. Thus, the time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n), where n is the number of versions.
Space Complexity:

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) because it uses only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. The algorithm doesn't require any additional data structures that grow with the input size; it only uses a few variables to keep track of indices.
